# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The World History Simulation Engine currently contains several systems (AlignmentSystem, InfluenceSystem, PrerequisiteSystem, PrestigeSystem, PersonalitySystem, and RaceSystem) that were originally designed for an interaction manager application. These systems need to be refactored to better align with the historical world simulation domain and clean architecture principles.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Clean Architecture Compliance

**User Story:** As a simulation engine developer, I want the systems to follow clean architecture principles, so that the codebase maintains proper separation of concerns and is easier to maintain.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN systems are refactored THEN they SHALL be placed in appropriate architectural layers (domain/entities, domain/services, domain/value-objects)
2. WHEN systems handle core business logic THEN they SHALL be placed in the domain layer
3. WHEN systems represent immutable concepts THEN they SHALL be implemented as value objects
4. WHEN systems manage entity state THEN they SHALL be implemented as domain services
5. WHEN systems are implemented THEN they SHALL follow TypeScript strict mode requirements

### Requirement 2: Historical World Simulation Adaptation

**User Story:** As a world simulation developer, I want the systems to be adapted for historical world simulation, so that they support character development, civilization dynamics, and emergent storytelling.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN AlignmentSystem is refactored THEN it SHALL support moral/ethical character development over time
2. WHEN InfluenceSystem is refactored THEN it SHALL track character influence within settlements and civilizations
3. WHEN PrestigeSystem is refactored THEN it SHALL manage character reputation and social standing in historical contexts
4. WHEN PrerequisiteSystem is refactored THEN it SHALL validate conditions for historical events and character actions
5. WHEN PersonalitySystem and RaceSystem are refactored THEN they SHALL integrate seamlessly with character generation and behavior

### Requirement 3: Serialization and Persistence Support

**User Story:** As a simulation engine user, I want the systems to support serialization and persistence, so that simulation state can be saved and restored.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any system is refactored THEN it SHALL implement toJSON() and static fromJSON() methods
2. WHEN systems are instantiated THEN they SHALL be immutable using Object.freeze()
3. WHEN systems are serialized THEN they SHALL properly handle Map and Set data structures
4. WHEN systems are deserialized THEN they SHALL reconstruct all internal state correctly

### Requirement 4: Character Entity Integration

**User Story:** As a character simulation developer, I want the systems to integrate properly with the Character entity, so that characters have coherent personalities, alignments, and social standings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Character entity uses systems THEN it SHALL compose them as services or value objects appropriately
2. WHEN Character entity is serialized THEN it SHALL include all system state
3. WHEN Character entity interacts with world THEN systems SHALL update based on actions and events
4. WHEN Character entity is created THEN racial modifiers SHALL be applied to personality and attributes

### Requirement 5: Temporal Evolution Support

**User Story:** As a historical simulation developer, I want the systems to support temporal evolution, so that character traits, alignments, and social standings can change over time based on historical events.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN historical events occur THEN character alignments SHALL be updated based on moral choices
2. WHEN characters interact with settlements THEN influence and prestige SHALL change based on actions
3. WHEN time progresses THEN personality traits SHALL evolve based on experiences and age
4. WHEN civilizations develop THEN social systems SHALL adapt to cultural changes
