# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The World History Simulation Engine's editor system currently has several critical usability issues that prevent users from effectively creating and managing worlds. The system lacks proper navigation between editors, has inconsistent button alignment, missing save functionality for nodes, no way to select existing worlds/nodes, and is missing the encounter system entirely. This feature will address these issues to create a cohesive, user-friendly editor experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Editor Navigation System

**User Story:** As a world builder, I want to easily navigate between different editors (world, node, character, interaction) so that I can efficiently create all components of my world.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I am in any editor THEN I SHALL see a consistent navigation system that allows me to switch between editors
2. WHEN I click on an editor navigation button THEN the system SHALL navigate to the correct editor page
3. WHEN I navigate between editors THEN the system SHALL preserve any unsaved work with appropriate warnings
4. WHEN I am on the world foundation editor THEN I SHALL see "Next Steps" buttons that lead to actual functional editor pages

### Requirement 2: Button Alignment and UI Consistency

**User Story:** As a user, I want consistent button alignment across all editors so that the interface feels polished and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view any editor except the interaction editor THEN all action buttons SHALL be center-aligned
2. WHEN I view the interaction editor THEN buttons SHALL maintain their current alignment (not center-aligned)
3. WHEN I view any editor THEN the button styling SHALL be consistent across all editors
4. WHEN I interact with buttons THEN they SHALL have consistent hover and active states

### Requirement 3: Node Save Functionality

**User Story:** As a world builder, I want to save nodes to my world so that I can build up a collection of locations and contexts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I create a node THEN I SHALL be able to save it to the current world
2. WHEN I save a node THEN it SHALL be persisted to localStorage with the world data
3. WHEN I save a node THEN I SHALL receive confirmation that the save was successful
4. WHEN I attempt to leave the node editor with unsaved changes THEN I SHALL receive a warning prompt

### Requirement 4: World and Node Selection System

**User Story:** As a world builder, I want to select from previously created worlds and nodes so that I can continue working on existing projects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I open the world foundation editor THEN I SHALL see a list of previously created worlds to choose from
2. WHEN I select an existing world THEN its data SHALL be loaded into the editor
3. WHEN I open the node editor THEN I SHALL see a list of existing nodes from the current world
4. WHEN I select an existing node THEN its data SHALL be loaded for editing
5. WHEN no worlds exist THEN I SHALL be guided to create a new world first

### Requirement 5: World Foundation Editor Save Requirement

**User Story:** As a world builder, I want to be required to save my world foundation before proceeding so that I don't lose my work and other editors have the necessary context.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I attempt to navigate away from the world foundation editor with unsaved changes THEN I SHALL be prompted to save first
2. WHEN I have not saved the world foundation THEN other editors SHALL display a message requiring world foundation completion
3. WHEN I save the world foundation THEN other editors SHALL become accessible
4. WHEN I save the world foundation THEN it SHALL be available for selection in future sessions

### Requirement 6: Navigation Element Cleanup

**User Story:** As a user, I want a clean navigation experience without redundant or non-functional navigation elements so that I can focus on world building.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view any editor page THEN I SHALL see only functional navigation elements
2. WHEN I click on navigation buttons THEN they SHALL lead to actual working pages
3. WHEN navigation elements are not functional THEN they SHALL be removed or replaced with working alternatives
4. WHEN I use the sidebar navigation THEN it SHALL provide quick access to all functional editors

### Requirement 7: Encounter System Integration

**User Story:** As a world builder, I want access to an encounter system so that I can create dynamic events and challenges within my world.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the editor system THEN I SHALL have access to an encounter editor
2. WHEN I create encounters THEN they SHALL integrate with the existing interaction system
3. WHEN I save encounters THEN they SHALL be associated with specific nodes or available globally
4. WHEN encounters are triggered in simulation THEN they SHALL use the existing interaction framework

### Requirement 8: Editor State Management

**User Story:** As a world builder, I want my editor state to be properly managed so that I don't lose work when switching between editors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I switch between editors THEN my current work SHALL be preserved
2. WHEN I have unsaved changes in any editor THEN I SHALL be warned before navigation
3. WHEN I return to an editor THEN my previous state SHALL be restored
4. WHEN I save in any editor THEN the save status SHALL be clearly communicated
