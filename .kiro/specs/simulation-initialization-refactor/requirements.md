# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature refactors the simulation initialization logic to provide better control over when simulations begin. Currently, the useSimulation hook runs automatically on app start, which is not ideal for user experience or system reliability. The new approach will require a valid world to be created and validated before any simulation can begin, giving users explicit control over the simulation lifecycle and ensuring proper initialization conditions are met.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using the simulation engine, I want the simulation to only start when a valid world exists, so that I can ensure proper initialization and avoid running simulations with incomplete or invalid configurations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the simulation SHALL NOT begin automatically
2. WHEN no valid world exists THEN the simulation SHALL remain in a stopped state
3. WHEN a world is created but not yet validated THEN the simulation SHALL NOT be allowed to start
4. WHEN a valid world exists THEN the simulation SHALL be available to start
5. IF the simulation is running AND the world becomes invalid THEN the simulation SHALL stop immediately

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user of the simulation engine, I want to create and configure a world with essential properties, so that I can define the simulation environment before running it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a world THEN the system SHALL provide mechanisms to set dimensions, rules, and initial conditions
2. WHEN building a world THEN the system SHALL allow step-by-step configuration via user input or predefined configurations
3. WHEN a world configuration is incomplete THEN the system SHALL indicate which properties are missing
4. WHEN all required world properties are set THEN the system SHALL mark the world as complete
5. IF world properties are modified THEN the system SHALL re-validate the world state

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user of the simulation engine, I want to populate my world with characters, nodes, and interactions using templates or custom creation, so that I can define the entities and behaviors that will participate in the simulation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a world is being built THEN the system SHALL allow adding characters (NPCs) from templates or custom creation
2. WHEN a world is being built THEN the system SHALL allow adding nodes (entities, agents, or objects) from templates or custom creation
3. WHEN a world is being built THEN the system SHALL allow defining interactions (rules for node behavior, collision, evolution) from templates or custom creation
4. WHEN adding characters THEN the system SHALL provide template selection with customization options
5. WHEN adding nodes THEN the system SHALL provide modular functions or components for dynamic addition/removal
6. WHEN defining interactions THEN the system SHALL store them in a central state object
7. WHEN characters, nodes, or interactions are modified THEN the system SHALL update the world validation status
8. IF characters have node assignments THEN the system SHALL validate those assignments are to valid nodes
9. IF nodes have dependencies THEN the system SHALL validate those dependencies are met

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user of the simulation engine, I want clear feedback about my world's validity status, so that I know when my world is ready for simulation and what needs to be fixed if it's not.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a world is being built THEN the system SHALL provide real-time validation feedback
2. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL display specific error messages indicating what needs to be corrected
3. WHEN a world becomes valid THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate the world is ready for simulation
4. WHEN validation status changes THEN the system SHALL update the UI to reflect the current state
5. IF multiple validation errors exist THEN the system SHALL display all errors in a prioritized list

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user of the simulation engine, I want an intuitive setup interface when no valid world exists, so that I can easily create and configure my simulation environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN no valid world exists THEN the system SHALL display a setup UI instead of simulation controls
2. WHEN in setup mode THEN the system SHALL guide users through world creation steps
3. WHEN setup is incomplete THEN the system SHALL prevent access to simulation controls
4. WHEN setup is complete THEN the system SHALL transition to the simulation interface
5. IF users want to modify an existing world THEN the system SHALL allow returning to setup mode

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user of the simulation engine, I want to use the existing template system to create, save, and manage templates for all world content, so that I can efficiently build worlds and reuse successful configurations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating world content THEN the system SHALL integrate with the existing TemplateManager
2. WHEN selecting templates THEN the system SHALL provide access to character, node, interaction, event, group, and item templates
3. WHEN using a template THEN the system SHALL allow customization of template properties before adding to world
4. WHEN world content is created THEN the system SHALL allow saving individual items or entire worlds as new templates
5. WHEN templates are modified THEN the system SHALL maintain template versioning and metadata
6. IF template dependencies exist THEN the system SHALL validate and resolve those dependencies
7. WHEN importing templates THEN the system SHALL validate template compatibility with current world

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user of the simulation engine, I want to create and customize characters/NPCs with detailed properties and assign them to world locations, so that I can populate my simulation with diverse and interesting entities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating characters THEN the system SHALL provide access to character templates with personality, cognitive, and emotional traits
2. WHEN customizing characters THEN the system SHALL allow modification of attributes, skills, background, race, and subrace
3. WHEN adding characters to world THEN the system SHALL require assignment to valid nodes/locations
4. WHEN characters are created THEN the system SHALL validate character configuration completeness
5. WHEN character-node relationships change THEN the system SHALL re-validate world consistency
6. IF character templates are used THEN the system SHALL preserve template lineage for future updates

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer integrating with the simulation engine, I want the useSimulation hook to conditionally start based on world validity, so that I can ensure simulations only run with proper initialization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN useSimulation hook is called THEN it SHALL check world validity before starting
2. WHEN world is invalid THEN the hook SHALL not initialize the simulation loop
3. WHEN world becomes valid THEN the hook SHALL be able to start the simulation
4. WHEN simulation is running AND world becomes invalid THEN the hook SHALL stop the simulation
5. IF world validation changes THEN the hook SHALL react appropriately to the new state
