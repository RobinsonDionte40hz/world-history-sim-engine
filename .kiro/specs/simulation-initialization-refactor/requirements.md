# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a manual, step-by-step world building system that gives users complete control over every aspect of their simulation. The system follows a mappless design where nodes represent abstract locations or contexts, not spatial positions. Characters are capability-driven, defined by what they can DO (interactions) rather than just their attributes. The world building process follows a strict dependency chain where each step requires previous steps to be completed, ensuring proper world construction and NPC-to-node assignment.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user of the simulation engine, I want to create a world with basic properties as the first step, so that I can establish the foundation for my simulation without any spatial constraints.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN starting world creation THEN the system SHALL require a world name and description
2. WHEN creating a world THEN the system SHALL allow setting rules for time progression and simulation parameters
3. WHEN creating a world THEN the system SHALL allow setting initial conditions without spatial dimensions
4. WHEN a world is created THEN the system SHALL prevent proceeding to other steps until world exists
5. IF no world exists THEN the system SHALL block access to node, interaction, and character creation

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user of the simulation engine, I want to create abstract nodes (locations/contexts) within my world, so that I can define the conceptual spaces where characters will interact.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating nodes THEN the system SHALL require a world to exist first
2. WHEN creating nodes THEN the system SHALL require name, type, and description for each node
3. WHEN creating nodes THEN the system SHALL allow setting environmental properties that affect character behavior
4. WHEN creating nodes THEN the system SHALL allow setting resource availability and cultural/social context
5. WHEN creating nodes THEN the system SHALL NOT require spatial coordinates or positions
6. WHEN creating nodes THEN the system SHALL allow conceptual connections between nodes
7. WHEN nodes are created THEN they SHALL be empty with no characters assigned yet

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user of the simulation engine, I want to create interactions (character capabilities) that define what characters can do, so that I can establish the possible actions before creating characters.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating interactions THEN the system SHALL require at least one node to exist first
2. WHEN creating interactions THEN the system SHALL support economic, resource gathering, exploration, social, combat, and crafting types
3. WHEN creating interactions THEN the system SHALL require name, type, requirements, branches, effects, and context
4. WHEN creating interactions THEN the system SHALL allow defining attribute, skill, or item requirements
5. WHEN creating interactions THEN the system SHALL allow multiple possible outcomes through branches
6. WHEN creating interactions THEN the system SHALL specify which nodes or situations allow the interaction
7. WHEN interactions are created THEN the system SHALL prevent character creation until at least one interaction exists

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user of the simulation engine, I want to create characters with assigned capabilities, so that I can define NPCs by what they can DO in the simulation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating characters THEN the system SHALL require both nodes and interactions to exist first
2. WHEN creating characters THEN the system SHALL require name, D&D attributes, personality traits, and consciousness properties
3. WHEN creating characters THEN the system SHALL require assignment of specific interactions the character can perform
4. WHEN creating characters THEN the system SHALL allow setting skills, abilities, and initial goals
5. WHEN creating characters THEN the system SHALL NOT automatically place them in nodes
6. WHEN assigning interactions THEN the system SHALL match character roles with appropriate capabilities
7. IF a merchant is created THEN they SHALL get trading, negotiation, and appraisal interactions

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user of the simulation engine, I want to populate nodes by assigning characters to specific locations, so that I can complete the world setup and enable simulation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN populating nodes THEN the system SHALL require both nodes and characters with interactions to exist
2. WHEN populating nodes THEN the system SHALL allow selecting a node and choosing which characters belong there
3. WHEN populating nodes THEN the system SHALL validate node capacity and thematic consistency
4. WHEN populating nodes THEN the system SHALL consider character roles matching node types
5. WHEN populating nodes THEN the system SHALL require each node to have at least one character
6. WHEN all nodes are populated THEN characters SHALL be able to perform their interactions within assigned nodes

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user of the simulation engine, I want the system to validate my world is ready for simulation, so that I can ensure all dependencies are met before starting.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN validation runs THEN the system SHALL check that a world exists
2. WHEN validation runs THEN the system SHALL check that at least one node exists
3. WHEN validation runs THEN the system SHALL check that all nodes have at least one character
4. WHEN validation runs THEN the system SHALL check that all characters have at least one interaction capability
5. WHEN all validations pass THEN the system SHALL enable the simulation start button
6. IF any validation fails THEN the system SHALL prevent simulation from starting

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user of the simulation engine, I want to save and reuse any component as a template, so that I can efficiently build future worlds and share configurations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating any component THEN the system SHALL allow saving it as a template
2. WHEN using templates THEN the system SHALL provide world, node, interaction, character, and composite template types
3. WHEN using templates THEN the system SHALL allow loading components from saved templates
4. WHEN using templates THEN the system SHALL include metadata like name, description, category, author, and version
5. WHEN using templates THEN the system SHALL support template browsing, search, and filtering
6. WHEN using templates THEN the system SHALL allow modification and variant creation
7. WHEN using templates THEN the system SHALL support import/export and sharing capabilities

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user of the simulation engine, I want clear step-by-step guidance through the world building process, so that I can understand the dependency chain and complete setup correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building a world THEN the system SHALL enforce the six-step dependency chain
2. WHEN building a world THEN the system SHALL provide clear visual indicators of current step and progress
3. WHEN building a world THEN the system SHALL prevent out-of-order operations
4. WHEN building a world THEN the system SHALL allow editing previous steps with cascading updates
5. WHEN building a world THEN the system SHALL provide contextual help at each stage
6. WHEN building a world THEN the system SHALL maintain referential integrity between components
7. IF dependencies are not met THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and guidance
