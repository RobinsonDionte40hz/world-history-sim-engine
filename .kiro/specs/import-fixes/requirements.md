# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical import path and export inconsistencies in the simulation engine codebase that can cause runtime failures in production environments. The fixes ensure proper module resolution by correcting filename casing mismatches and export type inconsistencies between named and default exports.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all import statements to use correct filename casing, so that the application works consistently across case-sensitive file systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application runs on a case-sensitive file system THEN all imports SHALL resolve correctly without module not found errors
2. WHEN importing Character.js THEN the import path SHALL use "Character.js" not "character.js"
3. WHEN importing Interaction.js THEN the import path SHALL use "Interaction.js" not "interaction.js"
4. WHEN any file imports domain entities THEN the import paths SHALL match the actual filename casing exactly

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent export/import patterns for services, so that modules can be imported without syntax errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN PrerequisiteValidator is imported THEN it SHALL be imported as a named export using destructuring syntax
2. WHEN a service exports a class using "export class" syntax THEN imports SHALL use named import destructuring
3. WHEN a service exports using "export default" syntax THEN imports SHALL use default import syntax
4. IF a module uses named exports THEN all imports of that module SHALL use the correct named import syntax

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all identified import issues fixed systematically, so that the codebase has consistent and working imports throughout.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Character.js is imported in InteractionResolver.js THEN the path SHALL be "../entities/Character.js"
2. WHEN Interaction.js is imported in InteractionResolver.js THEN the path SHALL be "../entities/Interaction.js"  
3. WHEN Character.js is imported in MemoryService.js THEN the path SHALL be "../entities/Character.js"
4. WHEN Character.js is imported in LocalStorageCharacterRepository.js THEN the path SHALL be "../../domain/entities/Character.js"
5. WHEN PrerequisiteValidator is imported in Character.js THEN it SHALL use named import syntax: "import { PrerequisiteValidator }"

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want verification that all import fixes work correctly, so that I can be confident the changes don't break existing functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN all import fixes are applied THEN existing tests SHALL continue to pass
2. WHEN the application starts THEN there SHALL be no module resolution errors
3. WHEN any fixed import is used THEN the imported module SHALL be accessible and functional
4. IF any import fix causes a test failure THEN the issue SHALL be identified and resolved before completion
