## Recommendations

### For Development Team
1. **Use `turn-counter-integration-working.test.js`** as the primary integration test suite
2. **Focus on fixing the 6 failing tests** to improve coverage
3. **Maintain the passing tests** as regression protection
4. **Add new tests** as functionality is enhanced

### For Future Development
1. **localStorage restoration** needs implementation work
2. **Error handling edge cases** need attention
3. **Turn counter fallback display** requires fixes
4. **State synchronization** could be improved

## Conclusion

The integration tests successfully demonstrate that the core turn counter functionality is working as expected. With **15 out of 21 tests passing**, the system shows solid integration between components, services, and UI elements. The failing tests identify specific areas for improvement and provide a roadmap for future development.

The tests serve as both **validation of current functionality** and **documentation of expected behavior**, making them valuable for ongoing development and maintenance.
